This project aims to develop a dynamic and interactive dashboard for the Champions Challenge program. 
The dashboard provides insights into user participation, learning progress, and reward achievements within a structured challenge framework. 

Using Power BI, the visualization highlights key performance metrics, such as:

User engagement trends over time.
Lesson completion rates and overall learning progress.
Distribution and tracking of rewards based on achieved goals.
This initiative supports data-driven decision-making and fosters a deeper understanding of user behaviors and outcomes in educational challenges.
